# Engineering and Urology Society 2018 Meeting Submission

## Preprint
[A Balance Cascade of Deep Neural Networks for CT Renal Segmentation](http://distrob.cs.umn.edu/eus18/preprint.pdf)

## Data
Our data-set can be found on the [project page](http://distrob.cs.umn.edu/eus18/).

## This Code
We are making this code available to give a complete record of the approach
we took in this work. We are not, at this time, able to support full maintenance
of this repository, and if you attempt to run it on your own setup, you will
need to root out a number of instances in which it was unintentionally "hard-coded"
for our purposes. Please feel free to contact Nicholas Heller at
[helle246@umn.edu](mailto:helle246@umn.edu) for help with this.
